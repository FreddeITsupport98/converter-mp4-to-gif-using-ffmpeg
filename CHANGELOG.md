# Changelog

All notable changes to Smart GIF Converter will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-10-26

### üöÄ Performance Revolution

#### Smart Cache Detection System
- **Memory-Based Cache Lookups**: Complete rewrite of cache pre-scan system
  - Old: 200+ individual grep searches through cache file (10+ seconds)
  - New: Single load into associative array with O(1) lookups (<1 second)
  - **Result**: 10x faster cache pre-scanning

- **Intelligent Resume from Interruption**
  - Files analyzed before Ctrl+C are saved to cache
  - Next run automatically detects cached files and skips them
  - Only processes NEW, CHANGED, or uncached files
  - **Result**: Zero wasted work when resuming

- **Change Detection with Fingerprinting**
  - Uses file size + modification time (mtime) for instant change detection
  - No expensive MD5 recalculation for unchanged files
  - Automatically re-analyzes only files that have changed
  - **Result**: Efficient incremental updates

#### Automatic Cache Maintenance
- **Self-Cleaning Cache**: Runs automatically every 7 days in background
  - Removes entries for deleted files
  - Removes duplicate entries (keeps only latest)
  - Removes old entries (>30 days)
  - Tracked via `.last_cleanup` marker file
  - **Result**: Cache stays lean without manual intervention

- **Cache Optimization Results**
  - Real-world example: 620+ entries (115KB) ‚Üí 0 entries (181 bytes)
  - 99% size reduction after cleanup of deleted file entries
  - Manual cleanup command: `./convert.sh --clean-cache`

### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Reliability

#### Process Management
- **Single Instance Lock**
  - Prevents multiple concurrent script executions
  - Lock file: `~/.smart-gif-converter/script.lock`
  - Detects and cleans stale locks from crashed processes
  - Shows helpful error with running PID if script already active

- **Process Group Management**
  - All child processes bound to terminal session
  - Clean termination of ALL ffmpeg processes on interrupt
  - No orphaned processes after Ctrl+C or terminal close
  - Process group tracking with `SCRIPT_PGID`

#### Data Integrity
- **Corruption-Proof Cache**
  - Atomic write operations using temporary files
  - Automatic integrity validation on every read
  - Automatic rebuild if corruption detected
  - Backup system (`.safe` files) for recovery

- **Cache Index Format v2.0**
  - Format: `filename|filesize|filemtime|timestamp|analysis_data`
  - Uses size+mtime fingerprint (no MD5 needed for validation)
  - Automatic migration from old format (v1.0)
  - Version checking prevents compatibility issues

### ü§ñ AI Intelligence Enhancements

#### AI Generation Tracking
- **Learning Progress Monitoring**
  - Tracks AI "generation" number (increments on model rebuilds)
  - Displayed during conversions: "Using AI generation: X"
  - Persistent across script runs
  - Shows AI improvement over time

#### Enhanced Duplicate Detection
- **4-Level Similarity Analysis**
  - Level 1: Exact binary match (MD5 checksums)
  - Level 2: Visual similarity (perceptual hashing)
  - Level 3: Content fingerprinting (metadata analysis)
  - Level 4: Near-identical detection (size ratios, temporal analysis)

- **Smart Duplicate Caching**
  - Duplicate analysis results cached with `DUPLICATE_DETECT:` prefix
  - Separate from regular AI analysis cache
  - Parallel processing with configurable thread count
  - Visual progress showing cached vs analyzing files

#### Multi-Mode AI Analysis
- **Specialized Analysis Modes**
  - `smart`: Full analysis (content + motion + quality) - default
  - `content`: Focus on content type detection
  - `motion`: Focus on motion analysis and FPS optimization
  - `quality`: Focus on source quality analysis

- **Per-Video Quality Selection**
  - `--ai-auto-quality`: AI chooses different quality for each video
  - 4K sources ‚Üí Max quality
  - Screen recordings ‚Üí Medium quality (text-optimized)
  - Short clips ‚Üí High quality
  - Long movies ‚Üí Medium quality (balanced for size)

### üé® User Experience

#### Clickable Terminal Paths
- **Hyperlink Support** (Modern Terminals)
  - File paths become clickable in supported terminals
  - Click to open in system file manager
  - Works in: GNOME Terminal, kitty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal, Warp, Alacritty, Hyper
  - Graceful fallback to plain paths in unsupported terminals
  - Applied to: settings, logs, cache directory, training directory

#### Enhanced Progress Display
- **Accurate Progress Counters**
  - Shows only files needing analysis (not total files)
  - Example: "Processing 5/5" instead of "216/216" when 211 cached
  - Clear distinction between cached and analyzing
  - Real-time cache hit/miss statistics

- **Informative Pre-Scan Messages**
  ```
  üìä Found 216 GIF files (2.3GB total)
  üíæ Cached: 211 files (instant load)
  ‚ö° To analyze: 5 files (need MD5 calculation)
  ‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated time: ~1 minute
  ```

#### AI System Diagnostics
- **Comprehensive Status Display**
  - `./convert.sh --ai-status`: Full AI system overview
  - Shows: configuration, cache status, training data, generation number
  - Health monitoring with visual indicators (‚úì, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùå)
  - Cache hit rates and performance metrics
  - Clickable paths to all system files

### üìä Performance Metrics
