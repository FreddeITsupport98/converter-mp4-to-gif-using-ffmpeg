./convert.sh --update           # Download and install latest version
```

### **🔐 Release Fingerprint System**
The script now tracks the exact identity of your installed version:

- **🏷️ Fingerprint Storage**: `~/.smart-gif-converter/.release_fingerprint`
- **📝 Tracks**:
  - Version number (e.g., 5.2)
  - SHA256 checksum of installed script
  - GitHub release tag (e.g., v5.2)
  - GitHub release timestamp (Unix epoch)
  - Installation date and previous version

**🛡️ Protection Against**:
- ❌ Older releases being fetched as "updates"
- ❌ GitHub API returning stale/cached data
- ❌ Release confusion during simultaneous publishing
- ❌ Accidental downgrades
- ❌ Corrupted or tampered files
- ❌ Re-downloading same version

**✅ How It Works**:
1. On first run, creates fingerprint with SHA256 of current script
2. When checking updates, compares:
   - Remote timestamp > installed timestamp (REQUIRED)
   - Remote SHA256 ≠ installed SHA256 (detects hotfixes)
   - Remote version ≠ current version (detects new releases)
3. Only proceeds with update if ALL checks pass
4. After update, saves new fingerprint with verified SHA256 + timestamp

### **🤖 Advanced AI-Powered Scenarios**

#### **Let AI Choose Quality Per Video**
```bash
./convert.sh --ai-auto-quality
```

**What Happens:**
- **4K Source Video** (3840x2160, high bitrate) → AI selects "Max Quality"
- **Screen Recording** (1920x1080, low motion) → AI selects "Medium Quality" with text optimization
- **Short Animation** (720p, 5 seconds) → AI selects "High Quality" with color optimization
- **Long Movie Clip** (1080p, 5 minutes) → AI selects "Medium Quality" for reasonable file size
- **Low-Resolution Source** (480p) → AI selects "Low Quality" to avoid upscaling artifacts

**AI Decision Factors:**
1. **Source Resolution**: Higher resolution sources get higher quality settings
2. **Duration**: Longer videos get more aggressive compression
3. **Content Type**: Animations get color optimization, screencasts get text optimization
4. **Bitrate Analysis**: High-bitrate sources are treated as premium content
5. **Motion Complexity**: High-motion content gets higher frame rates

#### **Content-Specific AI Modes**
```bash
# For animation and artistic content
./convert.sh --ai-mode content --preset high

# For screen recordings and tutorials  
./convert.sh --ai-mode motion --preset medium

# For mixed content requiring quality analysis
./convert.sh --ai-mode quality --preset high
```

### **🚀 Professional Workflow Examples**

#### **Content Creator Workflow**
```bash
# Morning routine: batch process yesterday's content
./convert.sh --ai --preset high --parallel-jobs 6

# Quick social media story from phone recording
./convert.sh --file phone_video.mp4 --preset low --ai-mode smart

# High-quality portfolio piece
./convert.sh --file portfolio_demo.mov --preset ultra --ai-mode quality
```

#### **Developer Documentation Workflow**
```bash
# Convert screen recordings to GIFs for documentation
./convert.sh --ai-mode content --preset medium --aspect 16:9

# Batch process tutorial videos
for file in tutorial_*.mp4; do
    ./convert.sh --file "$file" --preset medium --ai-mode motion
done

# Create small preview GIFs
./convert.sh --preset low --max-size 1  # 1MB max file size
```

#### **Marketing Team Workflow**
```bash
# Process promotional videos for different platforms
./convert.sh --ai-auto-quality  # Let AI choose based on content

# Create Instagram-optimized square GIFs
./convert.sh --preset high --aspect 1:1 --resolution 1080:1080

# Batch process with quality control
./convert.sh --preset ultra --backup-original --progress-bar
```

### **💾 Smart Cache Management**

#### **Automatic Cache Optimization**
The cache system intelligently manages itself:

```bash
# Cache is automatically cleaned every 7 days
# - Removes entries for deleted files
# - Removes duplicate entries (keeps latest)
# - Removes old entries (>30 days)
# Runs in background, doesn't slow down startup
```

#### **Manual Cache Control**
```bash
# Force cache cleanup anytime
./convert.sh --clean-cache

# Check when last cleanup ran
cat ~/.smart-gif-converter/ai_cache/.last_cleanup | xargs -I {} date -d @{}

# View cache size and statistics
./convert.sh --ai-status  # Shows cache stats in AI diagnostics
```

#### **How Smart Detection Works**

**Scenario: Interrupted Analysis**
```bash
# Run 1: Start analyzing 216 GIF files
./convert.sh
# Analyzing... [50/216] → Press Ctrl+C

# Run 2: Resume automatically!
./convert.sh
# Smart detection:
# ✅ Cached: 50 files (instant load)
# ⚡ To analyze: 166 files (continue where left off)
# Only processes the remaining 166 files!
```

**Scenario: Added New Files**
```bash
# You have 100 analyzed GIFs in cache
# Add 10 new GIF files to directory

./convert.sh
# Smart detection:
# ✅ Cached: 100 files (skipped)
# ⚡ To analyze: 10 files (NEW)
# Only analyzes the 10 new files!
```

**Scenario: Modified Files**
```bash
# You edit/re-export a GIF file (changes size or mtime)

./convert.sh  
# Smart detection:
# ✅ Cached: 99 files (unchanged)
# ⚡ To analyze: 1 file (CHANGED)
# Automatically detects and re-analyzes only the changed file!
```

#### **Cache Performance**

| Operation | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Duplicate scan 216 files | ~8-12 minutes | ~5-10 seconds | **100x faster** |
| Resume after interrupt | Restart from 0 | Continue from N | **No wasted work** |
| Pre-scan 216 files | ~10 seconds | <1 second | **10x faster** |
| Re-run after no changes | Full re-analysis | Instant skip | **Infinite speedup** |
